# Empirical-Accuracy
Demystifying precision shooting.

The purpose of this guide is to evalute the effecacy of many concepts common in the arena of percision shooting.

## What is "Percision Shooting"
  
For this guide I will define "Precision Shooting" as the designed intent to discharge a firearm with a high degree of accuracy. Two major shooting disciplines encomposed includs:

Hunting: In this context, precision shooting enables the hunter to accurately target and humanely harvest game animals. Hunters must be proficient in calculating the effects of distances, understanding enviromental (weather) conditions, and executing proper shooting techniques  to ensure a successful hunt.

Competition: Precision shooting in competitive settings usually includes organized events where participants aim to achieve the highest possible scores by shooting targets from various distances and positions.  

These disiplins involve rifles, pistols, shotguns and require technique, focus, mental and physacl discipline.  This guide will mainly focus on analizing processes involving rifle hardware and ammonition.

## Budget 

IF you were wealthy you would need this guide... you could hire the best of the best to consult you on purchasing the best of the best.  This guide is intended to not just provide rational information but also sensable recomdations.     

## Skip the filler...

This guide is going to assume that the reader knows the basics of firearms and ammination.

## BLOT (Bottom Line On TOP)

Most mid tier rifles running factory ammo will outshot most shooters.  More than a handfull of "budget" tier rifles will do the same.  There is no magical encantation to make procision shooting "easy".  It is hard and nothing is changing that.
