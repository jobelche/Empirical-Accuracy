# Empirical Accuracy
Demystifying precision shooting.

The purpose of this guide is to evalute the effecacy of many concepts common in the arena of percision shooting.

## What is "Percision Shooting"
  
For this guide, "Precision Shooting" will be defined as the designed intent to discharge a firearm with a high degree of accuracy. Two major shooting disciplines encomposed includs:

Hunting: In this context, Precision Shooting enables the hunter to accurately target and humanely harvest game animals. Hunters must be proficient in calculating the effects of distances, understanding enviromental (weather) conditions, and executing proper shooting techniques to ensure a successful hunt.

Competition: Precision Shooting in competitive settings typocally envolves organized events where participants aim (pun intended) to achieve the highest possible scores by shooting targets from various distances and positions.

Both discipliens require profieientcies such as; calculating the effects of distances, understanding enviromental (weather) conditions, and executing proper shooting techniques.  Each disciplin will end with very differnt results.  A comparison might be successfully 

These disiplins involve rifles, pistols, shotguns and require technique, focus, mental and physacl discipline.  This guide will mainly focus on analizing processes involving rifle hardware and ammonition.

## Budget 

IF you were wealthy you wouldnt need this guide... you could hire the best of the best to consult you on purchasing the best of the best.  This guide is intended to not just provide rational information but also sensable recomdations.     

## Skip the filler...

This guide is going to assume that the reader knows the basics of firearms and ammination.  The temptation to fill the first 70 pages with definations of trigger shoes and blackpowder burn rates will be resisted.  That is what the index is for.  

B# BLOT (Bottom Line On TOP)

You dont need to do anything extroidanary to aquire competition level hardware.  

Most mid tier rifles with most mid tier glass running most mid teir ammonition will out perform most shooters.  More than a handfull of "budget" tier rifles brands will do the same.  There is no incantation you can say to a bag rest or magical rune to carve into the barrel to make procision shooting "easy".  Out shootin a store boughtght rifle is hard and nothing is changing that.  Anyone telling you differnt is selling somthing.  

Skip to the end of this guide for recomdation on hardware that is perfectly capable of ethically harvesting game or capable of getting you medaled in a local compatition.  

## THe proof is in the LLN

According to the Webster dictionary the Law of Large Numbers is "a theorem in mathematical statistics: the probability that the absolute value of the difference between the mean of a population sample and the mean of the population from which it is drawn is greater than an arbitrarily small amount approaches zero as the size of the sample approaches infinity"

If you read the above and it makes perfect sense, Congratulations you do not need this guide.  If you read that and thought WTF does tis have to do with a rifle then you might be the tager audiance.

A more jargon free defination is provided by wikipedia.  To quote wikipedia "the law of large numbers is a mathematical law that states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists.

If someone flips a coin 3 times and it lands heads up tree times you instenctively know their is not enopugh info to prove to you that coin will always land heads up.  No one would pay a prieum for that coin.  We all just instenctivle know that that coin isnt any better an landing hands up than any other coin.  Landing a coin heads up 3 times doesnt make it a heads up coin any more than printing a sub MOA 3 shot group makes a rifle a sub MOA rifle.  How many coin tosses does you insencts tell you to take before you start to belive the coin is differnt than the average.  That its a special coin.  Ten tosses?  Fifty tosses?  A thousand tosses?  For whatever reason humans seem to be better at detecting bad sample rates in simple systems but then easly accept bad sample rates in complex systems.  The good news is a lot of really smart people people figure out was to remove the human bias from the process.  When a slight human bias is the difference between wining a war or not, or launching a successful product or not these entities have successfully resorted to LLN.

## First you got to hit it.

In competive shooting, placing a shot is good enough.  Holes in the paper determin the score, the score determins the the success.  In hunting the shooter needs to be mindfull that a success has an ethical element.  THis guide will tend to focus on the optimization of hit placement above all other considerations.  THis means to a target focused compentation rifle is, IN MY HONOST OPNION, mostly unfit for harvesting game.  In compatiotin, saftey is paramount and hit placment next.  In huntings, safty is paramount and ethics is next.
