# Empirical Accuracy
Demystifying precision shooting.

The purpose of this guide is to evaluate the efficacy of many concepts common in the arena of precision shooting.

## What is "Precision Shooting"
  
For this guide, "Precision Shooting" will be defined as the designed intent to discharge a firearm with a high degree of accuracy. Two major shooting disciplines includes:

Hunting: In this context, Precision Shooting enables the hunter to accurately target and ethically harvest game animals.

Competition: Precision Shooting in competitive settings typically involves organized events where participants aim (pun intended) to achieve the highest possible scores by shooting targets from various distances and positions.

Both disciplines require proficiencies such as; calculating the effects of distances, understanding environmental (weather) conditions, and executing proper shooting techniques.  Each discipline will end with very different results. 

Other disciplines include Military and Law Enforcement.  These are out of bounds for this guide.  The focus will be primarily on competition shoots and apply those concepts, where applicable, to improve hunting proficiencies. 

## Budget 

If you are wealthy you wouldn't need this guide... you could hire the best of the best to consult you on purchasing the best of the best.  This guide is intended to not just provide rational information but also sensible recommendations.     

## Skip the filler...

This guide is going to assume that the reader knows the basics of firearms and ammunition.  The temptation to fill the first 70 pages with definitions of trigger shoes and black powder burn rates will be resisted.  That is what the index is for.  

## BLOT (Bottom Line On TOP)

You don't need to do anything extraordinary to acquire competition winning hardware.  

Most mid tier rifles with most mid tier optics running most mid tier ammunition will outperform most shooters.  More than a handful of "budget" tier rifles brands will do the same.  There is no incantation you can say to a bag rest or magical rune to carve into the barrel to make precision shooting "easy".  Out shootin a store bought rifle is hard and nothing is changing that.  Anyone telling you different is selling something.  

Skip to the end of this guide for recommendations on hardware that is perfectly capable of ethically harvesting game or capable of getting you medaled in a local competition.

## The old ways
My first rifle was sighted in using 3 shot groups.  I was instructed by my father to fire three shots before adjusting the scope.  I did as instructed and with a little less that half a box of 30-06 Core-Lokt remaining he and I were both satisfied that the rifle was "sighted in".  For most of my life afterwards I evaluated rifles and ammo based on three shot samples.  And why wouldn't I?  There have been countless game harvested with rifles based on three shot samples.  THe was simple, cheap and more importantly, it works!  

### Then the internet... 
It doesn't take long to realize that there are as many different ways of evaluating rifles and ammo as there were fathers and sons at the range... And they all seem to work just fine.  But something felt off.  How can so many different processes result in the same results?  I hesitantly realized that the old ways might actually be based in belief and faith.  It was devastating to also realize that an overwhelming majority of internet content was selling snake oil to reinforce those beliefs and faith.  How can anyone wade through the snake oil.

## The proof is in the LLN
According to the Webster dictionary the Law of Large Numbers is "a theorem in mathematical statistics: the probability that the absolute value of the difference between the mean of a population sample and the mean of the population from which it is drawn is greater than an arbitrarily small amount approaches zero as the size of the sample approaches infinity"

If you read the above and it makes perfect sense, Congratulations you do not need this guide.  If you read that and thought WTF does this have to do with a rifle then you might be the target audience.

A more jargon-free definition is provided by wikipedia.  To quote wikipedia "the law of large numbers is a mathematical law that states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists.

If someone flips a coin 3 times and it lands heads-up three times you instinctively know there is not enough info to prove to you that the coin will always land heads up.  No one would pay a premium for that coin.  We all instinctively know that that coin isn't any better at landing heads-up than any other coin.  Landing a coin heads up 3 times doesn't make it a heads up coin any more than printing a sub MOA 3 shot group makes a rifle a sub MOA rifle.  How many coin tosses does your instincts tell you to take before you start to believe the coin is different from the average.  Ten tosses?  Fifty tosses?  A thousand tosses?  For whatever reason humans seem to be better at detecting bad sample rates in simple systems but then easily accept bad sample rates in complex systems.  The good news is a lot of really rational people figured out the need to remove the human bias from the process.  When a slight human bias is the difference between winning a war or not, or launching a successful product or not these entities have successfully resorted to LLN.

### Mean Radius
In percision Shooting the mean radius is used to measure the accuracy of a group of shots. It represents the average distance between each shot and the center of the group.  This metric provides a more comprehensive measure of accuracy than simply measuring the distance between the two farthest shots (extreme spread).  Spread measures the two worst shots.  It is a uselfull metric but not the most usefull metric.  When applied to LLN Mean Radius becomes a much better metric.  

Compaired to the "old ways" calculating the mean radius is much more difficult to calculate.  The basics concept is determining the center of the group, measuring each printed shot from the center then finding the mean of each shot printed.  Use the following formula √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²) where (x₁, y₁) are the coordinates of the group center and (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of the shot hole.  

Using a "ladder" target and a spreadsheat can take the process form overly complicated to just a bit monotonous.  

TODO: Add examples of ladder targets and and excel spreadsheet with formulas

### Make a base line

In its most general sense, a baseline is a starting point or a reference point against which future measurements, observations, or comparisons are made. It represents the initial state or condition before a change, intervention, or experiment is introduced.

Once you have a baseline only change a single varable at a time.  An example of this could be to baseline your rifle with a realtive low cost ammo.  Then only change the ammo.  The result will tell you how much of a difference the ammo change makes.  The result might be that you discover budget ammo is perfectly effectiver for your needs.         




## First you gotta’ hit it.

In competitive shooting, placing a shot is good enough.  Holes in the paper determine the score, the score determines the success.  In hunting the shooter needs to be mindful that success has an ethical element.  This guide will tend to focus on the optimization of hit placement above all other considerations.  THis means a target focused competition rifle is, IMHO, mostly unfit for harvesting game.  In competition, safety is paramount and hit placement next.  In huntings, safety is paramount and ethics is next.
