# Empirical Accuracy: Demystifying Statistical Analysis of Shooting

**Struggling to prove your rifle upgrades actually work? This guide offers a data-driven way to test precision shooting.** It’s designed for shooters who can consistently fire a rifle system but want to objectively evaluate changes—like reloaded vs. factory ammo or a new chassis—using repeatable, reliable methods.

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

- Most mid-tier rifle systems (with mid-tier optics and ammo) outshoot most shooters.
- **Skill trumps gear:** Upgrades offer diminishing returns beyond a certain point.
- Budget rifles often perform similarly—outshooting them is costly and tough.
- No shortcut or gadget makes precision shooting "easy." Anyone claiming otherwise is likely selling something.

## The Evolution of Shooting Analysis: From Anecdote to Data

My first scoped rifle was sighted in with three-shot groups. My father taught me to fire three rounds, tweak the scope, and call it "good enough" after half a box of .30-06 Core-Lokt. It worked—countless game fell to rifles zeroed this way. For years, I judged systems and ammo with three shots. It was simple, cheap, and effective.

Then the internet arrived, exposing a dizzying array of methods—each with fans swearing by it. What changed for me was realizing "good enough" didn’t cut it when chasing MOA precision. **Online, untested claims and marketing hype thrive on flimsy evidence.** Forums overflow with tales of turning "good enough" rifles into sub-MOA wonders, but the math didn’t add up. How could so many tricks yield identical results? The old ways might confirm a rifle works, but they can’t prove sub-MOA performance. Worse, much of the internet peddles modern snake oil—overpriced gadgets promising miracles. A 1/4 MOA three-shot group on YouTube proves as much as a hole-in-one at a driving range.

**How to Spot Common Misleading Information:**

- **Small sample sizes:** A three-shot group touted as "sub-MOA."
- **Selective data:** "Excluding fliers" to shrink group size.
- **Lack of context:** No details on range, wind, or shooter skill.
- **Overly simplistic solutions:** A $20 gizmo claiming to halve your groups.

## The Proof is in the LLN (Law of Large Numbers)

The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) states that as sample size grows, your average gets closer to the true average. **In shooting, more shots reveal your rifle’s real performance.** Flip a coin three times and get heads each time—would you bet it’s a “heads-only” coin? No. Three flips don’t prove much, just like three shots don’t make a sub-MOA rifle. Instinct tells us 50 or 100 flips might reveal the truth, yet we often accept tiny shooting samples without question. Why? Simple systems (coins) feel intuitive; complex ones (rifles) cloud our judgment. Statisticians use LLN to cut through bias—whether picking a top athlete or testing ammo. More shots beat guesswork every time.

## Data is King: A Better System

Every shot counts. Ignoring data—like skipping "fliers"—wastes ammo and skews results. Build a database of every impact for statistical analysis. Start with the tools below, and use this free resource to simplify calculations: [LE Production Service](http://www.leproductionservice.com).

## Extreme Spread vs. Mean Radius: Understanding the Difference

Extreme Spread (ES)—the distance between your two farthest shots—only highlights your worst performers. It’s tempting to test with tiny groups (like three shots) to keep ES low, or toss “fliers” to flatter your ego. But that’s bias, not truth. It’s great for selling gear, not for testing it. Every shot you fire adds value; log them all to see the full picture.

ES does have a use: spotting major issues. If your $7k “sub-1/2 MOA” rifle prints a 6-inch ES in three shots, something’s broken—loose optics, bad ammo, or worse. You don’t need 20 rounds to diagnose that.

Mean Radius (MR) tells a richer story. It averages each shot’s distance from the group center, not just the outliers. Say you fire 3 shots with a 0.98-inch ES, then 10 shots with the same ES. Intuition says 10 shots at 1 inch beats 3 shots at 1 inch—but how much? MR quantifies it. The catch? Small samples (3 or 10 shots) don’t fully harness the Law of Large Numbers. Aim for 20+ shots for reliable stats.

Calculating MR takes effort: find the group center, measure each shot’s distance from it (using √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)), then average those distances.

## Make a Baseline: Establishing Your Starting Point

### Budget Considerations

Shooting isn’t cheap, and this method ups the upfront cost. A 20-shot baseline eats ammo—think $20-$50 per test, depending on caliber. But it saves money long-term by avoiding guesswork and dud upgrades. Invest early in data to cut future waste.

### Data Collection Procedure

A baseline is your rifle’s starting point before tweaks. Minimize variables: shoot indoors from a bench with bags, or a fixture if you’ve got one. I use a bag on an ammo shelf at an indoor range—imperfect, but it works. Control what you can (wind, position); note what you can’t (humidity, barrel heat).

Log every shot’s X (left/right) and Y (up/down) distance from the point of aim in millimeters—think 5 mm left, 3 mm up. Keep impacts above and right of the POA to avoid negatives, and use mm for precision (it’s like 24ths of an inch). I draw targets in Paint with a triangle bullseye—its sharp tip beats a circle for measuring. Print, shoot, and measure later with calipers (or a ruler and Sharpie). Limit shots per target to avoid confetti; save them for reference.

### Sample Size Recommendations

Start with 20 shots. Data gets reliable around 20, locks in by 30, and barely shifts past 50. Statisticians use tests like Shapiro-Wilk to check if your shots form a normal pattern (bell curve)—optional, but available on the website. In my tests, 20 shots usually suffice; I design targets for that. Include every shot—outliers have their own fix later.

## Sample Data Recording Table

| Shot # | X (mm) | Y (mm) |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| 1      | 5      | 3      |
| 2      | 2      | 7      |
| 3      | 8      | 1      |
| ...    | ...    | ...    |
| 20     | 4      | 6      |

**Note:** X is horizontal distance from the point of aim; Y is vertical distance.

## Beyond the Hardware: PPPP

**Position, Picture, Pull, Practice**—your skill shapes the data. Sloppy technique (wobbly stance, jerky trigger) muddies results, hiding your rifle’s true potential. Master these fundamentals:

- **Position:** Stay stable and consistent.
- **Picture:** Keep your sight clear and steady.
- **Pull:** Squeeze smoothly, no flinch.
- **Practice:** Drill deliberately to refine control.
