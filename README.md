# Empirical Accuracy
Demystifying precision shooting.

The purpose of this guide is to evaluate repeatable concepts common in the arena of precision shooting.

## What is "Precision Shooting"?
For this guide, "Precision Shooting" will be defined as the designed intent to discharge a firearm with a high degree of accuracy. Two major shooting disciplines include:

Hunting: In this context, Precision Shooting enables the hunter to accurately target and ethically harvest game animals.

Competition: Precision Shooting in competitive settings typically involves organized events where participants aim (pun intended) to achieve the highest possible scores by shooting targets from various distances and positions.

Both disciplines require proficiencies such as calculating the effects of distance, understanding environmental (weather) conditions, and executing proper shooting techniques. Each discipline will end with very different results.

Other disciplines include Military and Law Enforcement. These are outside the scope of this guide. The focus will be primarily on competition shoots and applying those concepts, where applicable, to improve hunting proficiencies.

## Budget
This guide is intended to not just provide rational information but also sensible recommendations.

## Skip the filler...
This guide is going to assume that the reader knows the basics of firearms and ammunition. The temptation to fill the first 70 pages with definitions of trigger shoes and black powder burn rates will be resisted. That is what the index is for.

## BLOT (Bottom Line On Top)
You don't need to do anything extraordinary to acquire competition-quality hardware.

Most mid-tier rifles with most mid-tier optics running most mid-tier ammunition will outperform most shooters. More than a handful of "budget"-tier rifle brands will do the same. There is no incantation you can say over a bag rest or magical rune to carve into the turret ring to make precision shooting "easy." Outshooting a store-bought rifle is hard, and nothing is changing that. Anyone telling you different is selling something.

## The old ways
My first rifle was sighted in using 3-shot groups. I was instructed by my father to fire three shots before adjusting the scope. I did as instructed, and with a little less than half a box of 30-06 Core-Lokt remaining, he and I were both satisfied that the rifle was "sighted in." For most of my life afterward, I evaluated rifles and ammo based on three-shot samples. And why wouldn't I? There have been countless game harvested with rifles sighted in based on three-shot samples. It is simple, cheap, and, more importantly, it works!

### Then the internet...
It doesn't take long to realize that there are as many different ways of evaluating rifles and ammo as there were fathers and sons at the range... And they all seem to work just fine. But something felt off. How can so many different processes result in the same results? I hesitantly realized that the old ways might actually be based on belief and faith. It was devastating to also realize that an overwhelming majority of internet content was selling snake oil to reinforce those beliefs and faith.

## The proof is in the LLN
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the Law of Large Numbers is "a theorem in mathematical statistics: the probability that the absolute value of the difference between the mean of a population sample and the mean of the population from which it is drawn is greater than an arbitrarily small amount approaches zero as the size of the sample approaches infinity."

If you read the above and it makes perfect sense, congratulations; you do not need this guide. If you read that and thought, "WTF does this have to do with a rifle?" then you might be the target audience.

A more jargon-free definition is provided by Wikipedia. To quote Wikipedia, "The law of large numbers is a mathematical law that states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists."

If someone flips a coin 3 times and it lands heads-up three times, you instinctively know there is not enough info to prove to you that the coin will always land heads up. No one would pay a premium for that coin. We all instinctively know that that coin isn't any better at landing heads-up than any other coin. Landing a coin heads up 3 times doesn't make it a heads-up coin any more than printing a sub-MOA 3-shot group makes a rifle a sub-MOA rifle. How many coin tosses does your instinct tell you to take before you start to believe the coin is different from the average? Ten tosses? Fifty tosses? A thousand tosses? For whatever reason, humans seem to be better at detecting bad sample rates in simple systems but then easily accept bad sample rates in complex systems. The good news is a lot of really rational people figured out the need to remove the human bias from the process. When a slight human bias is the difference between winning a war or not, or launching a successful product or not, these entities have successfully resorted to LLN.

### Group size is less useful.
Stop basing your system off group size (extreme spread). If you care about precision, compare each impact from every other impact. Each piece of data added (increasing sample size) makes your data as a whole more accurate. You are paying for the ammo; the least you can do is log every shot. Record the distance from Point of Aim and muzzle velocity (if you have a chronograph).

### Mean Radius is more useful.
For this guide, the mean radius is used to measure the dispersion of a group of shots. MR is the average distance of each impact from the center of the group. This metric provides a more comprehensive measure of accuracy than simply measuring the distance between the two farthest shots (extreme spread). Extreme spread measures the two worst shots. Mean Radius becomes a much better metric.

Compared to the "old ways," calculating the mean radius is much more difficult. The basic concept is determining the center of the group, measuring each printed shot from the center, then finding the mean of each shot printed. Use the following formula: √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²) where (x₁, y₁) are the coordinates of the group center and (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of the shot hole.

Don't let the equation turn you off from the process. Your phone has more compute power than the entire solar system had in the 1950s; technology will make this process simple.

Make a baseline
In its most general sense, a baseline is a starting point or a reference point against which future measurements, observations, or comparisons are made. It represents the initial state or condition before a change, intervention, or experiment is introduced.

Make a baseline
In its most general sense, a baseline is a starting point or a reference point against which future measurements, observations, or comparisons are made. It represents the initial state or condition before a change, intervention, or experiment is introduced.

Once you have a baseline, only change a single variable at a time. An example of this could be to baseline your rifle with a relatively low-cost ammo. Then only change the ammo. The result will tell you how much of a difference the ammo change makes. The result might be that you discover budget ammo is perfectly effective for your needs.

First you gotta’ hit it.
In competitive shooting, placing a shot is good enough. Holes in the paper determine the score; the score determines the success. In hunting, the shooter needs to be mindful that success has an ethical element. This guide will tend to focus on the optimization of hit placement above all other considerations. This means a target-focused competition rifle is, IMHO, mostly unfit for harvesting game. In competition, safety is paramount, and hit placement is next. In hunting, safety is paramount, and ethics is next.
