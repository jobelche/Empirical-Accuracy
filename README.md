# Empirical Accuracy: A Statistical Approach to Precision Shooting Analysis

**This guide provides a systematic, data-driven methodology for evaluating precision shooting performance.** It is intended for individuals with the ability to consistently operate a rifle system and who seek to objectively assess modifications—such as comparing reloaded versus factory ammunition or transitioning to a precision chassis—through repeatable, evidence-based techniques.

## BLUF:  Bottom Line Up Front

**Shooter proficiency is the primary determinant of performance; equipment enhancements yield progressively smaller benefits.**  Mid-teir modern rifles often exhibit exemplery performance, and surpassing their capabilities requires significant investment and effort.  No device or technique can simplify precision shooting.  Anyone tell you differently is trying to sell you somthing.

## Historical Context: Transitioning from Anecdotal to Statistical Evaluation

My first experience with a scoped rifle was sighting in using three-shot groups. Under my father’s direction, I fired three rounds, adjusted the scope, and repeated until it was deemed satisfactory.  Leaving with still over half of the single box of .30-06 Core-Lokt that was brought.  Pretty sure that box lasted at least 2 more seasons.  This approach proved effective for my purposes.  I was indocternated.  For years, I relied on three/five-shot groups to assess rifle systems becuase, well, it is simplicit, cost-effective, and adequat.

Then came the internet and with it as many forum posts and methods as there were fathers and sons needing to sight in a rifle.  Each endorsed by its proponents.  But somthing wasnt adding up.  How can so many differnt methods claiming to be the best still end up with the same results.  If every method was best how could any be the best.  With so many methods in compatition to be the "right" method a new peridimn paradigm formed...  the MOA became above reproach.  If the method was the religion then the MOA become the martyr.  People were less interested in figuring out the best way to evalute a rifle system and more instered in getting a three shot group with a small MOA.  Its unclear if the MOA was pushed by the snake oil salesmen or if they just adopted it.  Traditional practices may confirm operational reliability but cannot substantiate sub-MOA performance. Moreover, much online content promotes unproven solutions, undermining objective analysis. A video demonstrating a 0.25 MOA three-shot group holds little evidentiary weight, akin to an isolated success in a controlled setting.

**Indicators of Unreliable Information:**

- **Limited sample sizes:** Assertions based on three-shot groups labeled as "sub-MOA."
- **Selective reporting:** Exclusion of outliers to artificially improve results.
- **Insufficient detail:** Absence of testing conditions, such as range or environmental factors.
- **Overstated simplicity:** Claims that inexpensive tools can significantly enhance precision without evidence.

## Statistical Foundation: The Law of Large Numbers

The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) posits that as the number of observations increases, the sample mean approaches the true population mean. **In precision shooting, larger shot counts provide a more accurate depiction of a rifle system’s performance.** Consider a coin flipped three times, all resulting in heads: this outcome does not confirm a bias toward heads. Similarly, a three-shot group does not definitively establish sub-MOA capability. Intuitively, one might require 50 or 100 flips to assess a coin’s true nature, yet small shooting samples are often accepted without scrutiny. This discrepancy arises because simple systems are more easily evaluated, while complex systems like rifles obscure judgment. Statistical methods, such as those employed in performance analysis or ammunition testing, leverage the LLN to eliminate subjectivity. Increased shot counts enhance reliability over anecdotal assessments.

## Data-Driven Evaluation: A Superior Methodology

All shots contribute valuable information. Discarding data, such as outliers, compromises accuracy and wastes resources. The objective is to compile a comprehensive database of shot impacts for statistical analysis.

## Comparing Extreme Spread and Mean Radius

Extreme Spread (ES) measures the distance between the two furthest shots, emphasizing the least favorable outcomes. Relying solely on small groups or excluding outliers introduces bias, which may benefit promotional efforts but undermines objective testing. Every recorded shot enhances the dataset’s integrity.

ES remains useful for diagnosing significant malfunctions. For instance, a $7,000 rifle advertised as sub-0.5 MOA yielding a 6-inch ES after three shots suggests issues such as unsecured optics or defective ammunition, requiring no further testing to identify a problem.

Mean Radius (MR) offers a more thorough assessment by averaging the distance of each shot from the group’s center, rather than focusing on extremes. For example, a 3-shot group with a 0.98-inch ES compared to a 10-shot group with the same ES intuitively differs in quality; MR quantifies this distinction. However, small samples (e.g., 3 or 10 shots) limit the applicability of the Law of Large Numbers. A minimum of 20 shots is recommended for dependable results.

MR calculation involves determining the group center, measuring each shot’s distance using the formula √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²), and computing the average. Modern technology simplifies this process. A free tool for marking shots and performing calculations is available at [LE Production Service](http://www.leproductionservice.com).

## Establishing a Baseline

### Cost Considerations

Precision shooting entails significant expense, and this methodology increases initial costs. A 20-shot baseline may require $20 to $50 in ammunition, depending on caliber. However, this investment reduces long-term inefficiencies by minimizing reliance on untested modifications.

### Data Collection Protocol

A baseline represents the rifle system’s performance prior to alterations. Conduct testing in a controlled environment, such as an indoor range with a bench rest, to minimize variables. Personally, I utilize a rest on an ammunition shelf at an indoor facility, acknowledging its limitations. Control measurable factors (e.g., wind, shooter position) and document uncontrollable variables (e.g., humidity, barrel temperature).

Record each shot’s horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) distance from the point of aim in millimeters (e.g., 5 mm left, 3 mm up). Positioning impacts above and to the right of the point of aim eliminates negative values, and millimeter measurements provide precision equivalent to 24ths of an inch. Targets are designed in a basic graphics program with a triangular bullseye, offering a precise point for measurement compared to circular designs. Shots are fired, targets preserved, and measurements taken later using calipers (or a ruler and marker). Limit shots per target to maintain clarity.

### Sample Size Guidance

A minimum of 20 shots is advised. Statistical reliability emerges around 20 shots, stabilizes by 30, and remains consistent beyond 50. Advanced tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk method, assess data normality and are available on the referenced website, though optional. Based on experience, 20 shots suffice for practical purposes; targets are designed accordingly. All shots, including outliers, should be recorded, with separate methods to address anomalies.

## Sample Data Table

| Shot # | X (mm) | Y (mm) |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| 1      | 5      | 3      |
| 2      | 2      | 7      |
| 3      | 8      | 1      |
| ...    | ...    | ...    |
| 20     | 4      | 6      |

**Note:** X denotes horizontal distance from the point of aim; Y denotes vertical distance.

## Shooter Fundamentals: Position, Picture, Pull, Practice

**Shooter technique significantly influences data quality.** Inconsistent methods (e.g., unstable positioning or abrupt trigger activation) introduce variability, obscuring the rifle system’s true performance. Focus on these principles:

- **Position:** Maintain a stable, repeatable stance.
- **Picture:** Ensure a clear, consistent sight alignment.
- **Pull:** Execute a smooth, controlled trigger press.
- **Practice:** Engage in regular, deliberate training to enhance proficiency.
